# The code imported from above shows how we defined q, q_dot, and necessary system parameters.
# Then we used position, velocity, and angular velocity to calculate kinetic energy.

# defining potential energy
g = symbols("g")

P = (
    m * g * ell / 2.0 * sin(theta)
)  # this is "mgh", where "h" is a function of generalized coordinate "q"

# can also do the following to get the same answer
#   g_vec = Matrix([[0], [g], [0]])  # defining gravity in the direction that increases potential energy
#   p1 = Matrix([[ell/2*cos(theta)], [ell/2*sin(theta)], [0]])
#   P = m*g_vec.T@p1
#   P = P[0,0]

# calculate the lagrangian, using simplify intermittently can help the equations to be
# simpler, there are also options for factoring and grouping if you look at the sympy
# documentation.

# Solution for Euler-Lagrange equations, but this does not include right-hand side (like friction and tau)

# The next step is to save this function "f" so that we can use it with a numerical integrator, like
# scipy.integrate.ivp.solve_ivp or the rk4 functions in the case studies. To save this function, we can use the following:

# this code will only run if this file is executed directly,
# not if it is imported as a module.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from case_studies import A_arm

        "ell": P.ell,
        "b": P.b,
    }

    x_test = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
